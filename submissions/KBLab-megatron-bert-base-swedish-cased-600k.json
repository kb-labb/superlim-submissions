Its [sister model](https://huggingface.co/KBLab/megatron-bert-base-swedish-cased-125k) used the same setup, but was instead trained for only 125k steps.\n\n\nThe model has three sister models trained on the same dataset:\n- [\ud83e\udd17 BERT Swedish](https://huggingface.co/KBLab/bert-base-swedish-cased-new)\n- [Megatron-BERT-base-125k](https://huggingface.co/KBLab/megatron-bert-base-swedish-cased-125k)\n- [Megatron-BERT-large-110k](https://huggingface.co/KBLab/megatron-bert-large-swedish-cased-110k)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the HPC RIVR consortium (https://www.hpc-rivr.si) and EuroHPC JU (https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu) for funding this research by providing computing resources of the HPC system Vega at the Institute of Information Science (https://www.izum.si)."
