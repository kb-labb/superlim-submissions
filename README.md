# SuperLim Submissions

This is the official repository for submitting new entries to the SuperLim leaderboard, as well as downloading previous entries.

For your submission to be accepted we require you 
*1)* to fill the `json`-file containing your model's information and results for the tasks that you submit to, 
*2)* add your actual result files in the official `jsonl`-format, adding a `prediction` key for each instance,
and finally *3)* provide a link to your repository containing the scripts, parameters, random seeds, and sufficient guidance to recreate your results.
